# Behavioral Analysis of PSI-Agents in a Multi-Agent Simulation of two Adversarial Groups

This simulation was developed during the creation of my bachelor thesis at the Freie Universität Berlin. It was designed according to the PSI-Theory that Dörner introduced in 1999.
During the development, I made several adaptions to the original formulation. A detailed description of the simulation can be found in my thesis.

For the execution, you will need Unity. I have used version 2021.3.0f1.
